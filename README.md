# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

## 📌 Overview
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a critical business metric that estimates the total revenue a customer is expected to generate over their relationship with a company.

This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer lifetime value using transactional and behavioral data, helping businesses improve customer segmentation and strategic decision-making.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:

- Customer purchase history
- Transaction frequency
- Recency metrics
- Monetary value
- Behavioral attributes

Data preprocessing and feature engineering were performed to prepare the dataset for model training.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- SQL (for data querying and preprocessing)

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering (RFM metrics, etc.)
4. Model Training (Regression models)
5. Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE)
6. Customer Segmentation based on predicted CLV

---

## 📈 Results
The model successfully predicts customer lifetime value and enables segmentation into value-based categories for targeted business strategies.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Deploy model using Streamlit
- Integrate real-time transaction data
- Improve feature engineering with advanced behavioral metrics
